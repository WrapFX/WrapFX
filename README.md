### Hi, i'm Wrap!

I'm a high schooler that used to code.

### Naming traditions

Most of my projects are named after some plant or bird.

Also, the vast majority of my projects end with FX (IE: FinchFX, PassFX, IvyFX). I do it like this for the sake of recognizability and a little bit of personality to these names.
