### Hi, i'm Wrap!

I'm a high schooler studying to be a software engineer in the future.

### Languages

| Language | Skill |
|-|-|
| Python | Beginner |
| Haxe | Beginner |
| C++ | Intermediate |
| C# | Intermediate |
| Rust | Intermediate |

**Notes:**

- I've never really liked Python, so i haven't used it much.
- I started learning a little bit of Haxe, but it just didn't fit the style of project i wanted to build. I do plan on using it on future projects though.
- I really liked C++, but stopped using it because of the memorey safety issues (and other languages seemed more attractive).
- I used C# for quite a while, but quit coding in it when i started to go more low level into things.
- I LOVE Rust! My plan is to learn it fully and become a full time Rust programmer. It is gonna be a rocky journey, due to Rust's steep learning curve, but that shouldn't be much of a problem. Also, "intermediate" is a bit of far shot here, there should be another difficulty level just for Rust.
